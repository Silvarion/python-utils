# python-utils
Some basic utils for Python programmers. This is a training for myself. No rocket science here.

# How to use it:

You can add the py file to one of Python's search paths or put it in a custom locatiuon and add the following lines to your code.

    import sys
    sys.path.append('/path/to/pythils_dir')
    import pythils
